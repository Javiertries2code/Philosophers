array of deaths
if philo dies it prints death right away, and changes  deaths[] to true

when exiting thread.. main program checks  deaths[id],
 if true, it changes all the arrray to true
 so all philos only need to checks  its own deaths.

 using a maitre would require a continuous reading of such, meaning more dealay
